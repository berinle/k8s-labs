# Scaling, Logs and HA

## What you will learn
* How to scale your apps
* View application logs
* High availability and Self Healing

## Excercise

## Scale your application
* Create the deployment

```
kubectl create deployment articulate --image=berinle/articulate:02a18f91

-- output --
deployment.apps/articulate created
```

* Get the objects created as part of the deployment

```
kubectl get all

-- output --
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/articulate-5466968447-dhn5v   1/1     Running   0          19s

NAME                         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/articulate   1/1     1            1           19s

NAME                                    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/articulate-5466968447   1         1         1       19s
```

Notice a pod was automatically created as part of the deployment. Also notice there is a `ReplicaSet` associated with the deployment. This will be used to scale up/down the deployment as instructed.

* Scale to 3 copies of your application

```
kubectl scale deployments/articulate --replicas=3

-- output --
deployment.apps/articulate scaled
```

* Check the deployment rollout of the scale out

```
kubectl rollout status deployments/articulate

-- output --
Waiting for deployment "articulate" rollout to finish: 1 of 3 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for deployment "articulate" rollout to finish: 2 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "articulate" successfully rolled out
â€‹
```

* Get the deployment

```
kubectl get deployments/articulate

-- output --
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
articulate   3/3     3            3           5m17s
```

* Verify there are 3 pods now up and running

```
kubectl get pods -l app=articulate

-- output --
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
articulate-5466968447-5hjbp   1/1     Running   0          3m49s
articulate-5466968447-dhn5v   1/1     Running   0          6m39s
articulate-5466968447-lq9th   1/1     Running   0          3m49sm
```

## High Availablity

With 3 copies of the app running, lets trigger a failure on one of them and watch it recovery

* First expose the service so we can 

```
kubectl expose deployment/articulate --type=NodePort --name=articulate --port=8080

-- output --
service/articulate exposed
```

* Get the dynamically assigned port by listing the service

```
kubectl get service/articulate

-- output --
NAME         TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
articulate   NodePort   10.100.200.110   <none>        8080:32068/TCP   4s
```

* In a terminal window, watch the pods

```
kubectl get po -w -l app=articulate

-- output --
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
articulate-5466968447-5hjbp   1/1     Running   0          70m
articulate-5466968447-dhn5v   1/1     Running   0          73m
articulate-5466968447-lq9th   1/1     Running   0          70m
```

* Open your browser and point to the application at `http://EXTERNAL-IP:PORT`
* Navigate to `Service & HA` tab and click the `Kill` button
* Notice one of the pods exits and is immediately brought back online

```

## Clean up the deployment

```
kubectl delete deployment,service -l app=articulate

-- output --
deployment.apps "articulate" deleted
service "articulate" deleted
```
